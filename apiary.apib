# TV Dashboard
TV dashboard API provides access to personalized tv content recommendation data.
Data provided by this API is normally presented in form of rows. Row, Content and 
VoD category are main entities at recommendation dashboard API model. Row provides 
organization to contents and is an actual presentation container of various types
as VoD content, TV show, TV series.
API is RESTfull by design, featuring lower complexity by pre-aggregating results, 
lower request count for consuming applications and overall programming convenance. 
That comes with price of having user scope methods with quick response times 
required. 


## Method call model
API isn't too chatty because of preloading required to achieve UI snappiness.
#### 
1. Level: fetch immediate data; when module starts.
 - Row; complete hierarchy.
 - Content; first page for all rows (except for low mem. devices).
 - Bitmap images; first page for all rows.
 - Profile data; any.
 - ???? Search index; page 1, max 2 chars ~25^2 combs.
2. Level: on demand data fetch; after initial data fetched and UI was generated.
 - Next page results.
 - Content details.
 - Content ratings, likes, favorites.
 - Next content in series.
 - Search results.
 - Playback data fetch (such as recordings from OA, make recordings, media info
   from OA).

## Application caching
Applications are not expected to cache 2. level requests locally due to memory 
constraints which isn't true for 1. level reuests.
